## MY STORY
* When in junior high school, my deskmate took his Motorola *Milestone*(codename of the mobile phone) and told me that Android phones can be flashed into 3nd party ROM. I went home and took my family's HTC G3 (codename *HERO*). I visited various forums every day when I had nothing to do, and flashed different ROMs into the *HERO*.

* In my freshman year, a classmate introduced me to buy a Tencent Cloud student computer for 1 yuan (can choose windows, ubuntu, centOS and other images), so I started to get in touch with Linux and built various services on my laptop (such as samba, ftp, nginx, shadowsocks, Intranet penetration, etc.) Interestingly, I used shadowsocks to achieve the freedom of Internet access for my roommates in the middle of the night (the dormitory area was disconnected on time at 12 o'clock, but the teaching area was constantly connected, and the traffic was transferred through a small Raspberry Pi)

* During the summer vacation before my junior year, I learned that we may have iOS dev courses for next semester, and that iOS development requires mac os. I successfully installed my HP laptop on Apple's Mac OS 10.12 and 10.13 through online tutorials, and successfully installed XCode.

## CAMPING EXPERIENCE

### TIMELINE 2021.02.12 to 2021.02.19
### BACKGROUND
My previous boss with extensive outdoor experience drove us on a tour of western China from Shenzhen in his off-road vehicle.

On New Year’s Eve, the instant noodles are also delicious.

### DAY 1 Donggan Reservoir, Nanning City, Guangxi Province
This is my first time staying in a tent, but it’s very lively next to the reservoir. Many people set up tents and have barbecues.

When I woke up the next day, it was a bit cold outside. Fortunately, my sleeping bag was warm. There were dewdrops on the corners of the tent in the morning.

There were no shops near the campground in the morning, so I fried eggs.

### DAY 2 Pogu Car Campground, Baise City, Guangxi Province
Driving all the way to the Pogu Car Camp, the conditions are better today because you can take a shower in this camp.

### DAY 3 to 4 Kunming City, Yunnan Province
Today we went to Kunming, Yunnan, to meet another colleague. He flew directly from Guangdong to Kunming. The self-driving tour for three people became a self-driving tour for four. Although the pace became slower due to the increasing number of people, it was more chatty.

I visited some ancient towns that day, but it was too cold, and I was staying in a B&B, so there was nothing special about it, so I didn’t take any pictures.

### DAY 5 to 6 Erhai Lake, Dali City, Yunnan Province
I have to say that Yunnan is a magical place full of flowers.

### DAY 7 Wumeng Prairie, Wumeng Town, Panzhou City, Liupanshui City, Guizhou Province
Driving to the top of Wumeng Prairie in Guizhou, there was a fairy atmosphere, and there were cattle and sheep (I almost got hit by teasing the cattle)
