## MY STORY
* When in junior high school, my deskmate took his Motorola Milestone(codename) mobile phone and told me that Android phones can be flashed 3nd party ROM. I went home and took my family's HTC G3 (codename hero). I visited various forums every day when I had nothing to do, and installed the flash the ROM into the HTC G3.

* In my freshman year, a classmate introduced me to buy a Tencent Cloud student computer for 1 yuan (can choose windows, ubuntu, centOS and other images), so I started to get in touch with Linux and built various services on my laptop (such as samba, ftp, nginx, shadowsocks, Intranet penetration, etc.) Interestingly, I used shadowsocks to achieve the freedom of Internet access for my roommates in the middle of the night (the dormitory area was disconnected on time at 12 o'clock, but the teaching area was constantly connected, and the traffic was transferred through a small Raspberry Pi)

* During the summer vacation before my junior year, I learned that we may have iOS dev courses for next semester, and that iOS development requires mac os. I successfully installed my HP laptop on Apple's Mac OS 10.12 and 10.13 through online tutorials, and successfully installed XCode.
